\title{Estimation of the Population Total under Stratified Probability Proportional to Size Sampling With Replacement}
\description{Computes the Hansen-Hurwitz estimator of the population total according to a probability proportional to size
sampling with replacement design}
\usage{
E.STPPS(y, pk, mh, S)
}
\arguments{
\item{y}{Vector, matrix or data frame containig the recollected information of the variables of interest for every
unit in the selected sample}
\item{pk}{A vetor containing selection probabilities for each unit in the sample}
\item{mh}{Vector of sample size in each stratum}
\item{S}{Vector identifying the membership to the strata of each unit in selected sample}
}
\seealso{
\code{\link{S.STPPS}}
}
\details{Returns the estimation of the population total of every single variable of interest, its estimated variance and its
estimated coefficient of variation in all of the stratum and finally in the entire population}
\value{The function returns an array composed by several  matrices representing each varible of interest. The columns of each matrix
correspond to the estimated parameters of the variables of interest in each stratum and in the entire population}
